INTRODUCTION
============
Every men has a goal in life, mine is to drink every energy drink in the
world!

In this process i want to review, categorize and describe every one of
them. The idea is to create a database of all energydrink i ever drunk,
completely with ingredients like caffeine or sugar.

For that i will design a database scheme which can handle my demands, as
well as a web frontend which is able to search through and view the entries
very similar to a cms. Currently there is only a static site generator with
some templates, more will come.


Usage
=====
you will need the following things to add new drinks automagically and
generate the database.

- python 2.6
- simplejson (pip install simplejson)
- pystashe (Mustache for python), currently a fork which fixes inner
  contexts from http://github.com/rafaelcv/pystache
- markdown (pip install markdown) for genrating html from this README

Help me!
========
I would be more than glad if something of this project helped you, you may
send me one of the energy drinks i have never drank before ( check db).
Send me a quick mail and we might meet up somewhere here in germany.
