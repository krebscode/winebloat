        taste any different from all the other energy drinks. It somewhat
        tastes more like bubble gum (like HubbaBubba) than Gummy bears and
        it is, like most of these drinks, very sweet. It does not taste bad
        or anything, but i expected more of Maca(whatever this stuff is
        anyway).",
