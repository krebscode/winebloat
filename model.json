        like Cola but it sure tastes like everything BUT cola. The taste is
        something between berry juice,citrus and Gummy bear taste. It
        somewhat reminds me of the Coke of Red bull, which does not taste
        good either.",

        really bad. It has a below average caffein content and far below
        average taurine content. It is not really my taste, check it out
        anyway if you get the chance, because the price is actually really
        cheap.",

        Actually this is really good and tasts well. For me it killed my
        thirst ( which is something special with energy drinks). Does not
        have this gummy bear taste or at least not really intense.",
        "Overall" : "This stuff is really great for the taste. Even though
        it does not have taurine in it, it gives you enough energy to move
        on on a lazy saturday. And for the price you at least have to try
        it once!",
